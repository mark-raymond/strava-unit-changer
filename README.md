strava-unit-changer
===================

This is a Greasemonkey script to change the units in Strava.

Installing
----------

1. Install [Greasemonkey] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

  [Greasemonkey] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) is a Firefox extension
  that allows you to run a script (such as this one) automatically when you visit web pages so you can
  customise them.

2. Install [this script] (https://github.com/mark-raymond/strava-unit-changer/raw/master/strava-unit-changer.user.js).

  [Click here] (https://github.com/mark-raymond/strava-unit-changer/raw/master/strava-unit-changer.user.js)
  to download the script. If you have Greasemonkey installed, it should prompt you to install the script.

3. (Optional) Customize units

  By default, this script uses miles and metres. If you want something different, you will need to edit the
  top of the script to change the units it uses.
